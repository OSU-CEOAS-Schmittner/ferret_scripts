This directory contains ferret scripts useful for comparison
of UVic model output to observations. 

It requires the observation data files. You need to edit the
paths to the directory which contains these data. 

The use is simple:
1) load your model data file: e.g. 
	yes? use tavg.01234.01.01.nc
2) set region: e.g.
	yes? set reg/l=7
3) call script
	yes? go pl_po4_xyav_2.8 1 l=7

Some scripts require arguments. See description in the
scripts. Some scripts work only for particular model
versions (see _2.8 or _2.7 ending). This labeling
might not be consistent for all scripts.

Files called pl_var_xyav plot basin wide vertical profies of variable var e.g. pl_temp_xyav plots potential temperature profiles.
Files called pl_var_sec plot meridional sections.
	     pl_var_xav plot zonal averages.
	     pl_varsfc_xav plot zonal averages of surface values.
